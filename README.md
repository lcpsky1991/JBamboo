Korovasoft JBamboo
==================

This is a Java implementation of the highly scalable Bamboo system for Finite Element Analysis. It will serve as an architectural prototype for Bamboo++, which will be focused on hardware-specific optimizations. The original Mathematica implementation is available at [mcknightcasey/Bamboo](https://github.com/mcknightcasey/Bamboo).
